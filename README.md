Project to create a webpage using advanced CSS grid layouts

I chose to re-create the project design file versus making my own design because I wanted to focus on being able to analyze a design file and know when to use grid and when to use flex-box to make everything line up as closely as I could get it. 

I learned a lot as I worked on this project. Specifically how to use grid template columns/rows with the repeat, minmax() and auto-fill and auto-fit to make layouts that automatically format to different screen sizes without the use of a media query . I also learned how to truncate a sentence with an ellipsis after 3 lines.

Please note that I chose not to make this page responsive for mobile devices, as I didn't think that it was necessary to understand the concepts that this project was meant to teach me.
